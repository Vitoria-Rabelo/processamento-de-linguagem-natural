This repository contains my progress in course of Alura about Process Language Natural.

The Natural Language Processing (NLP) program at Alura is a complete learning path for those who want to specialize in one of the most relevant areas of Data Science. All the content has been carefully designed so that, by the end, you will have the knowledge and skills necessary to apply NLP in different scenarios and real-world challenges, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), chatbot development, and text summarization.
